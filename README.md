## Description

Use Hopify to find beers and breweries in your city!

## List of the APIs Used:

-OpenBreweryDB
-BreweryDB
-Google Maps

## Technologies Used

-React
-Redux

## What Features You Would Add Next?

The next challenge for this project will be adding beer data to the database. My goal will be to automate this process, which will include writing code to scrape beer data from various brewery websites and then writing scripts to automate the importing of this data into my database. Once I am able to populate the database with valuable data about the beers that are available all over the country, the app will be that much more useful and appealing to users.
